# vue-details-form
Form with collapsible sections using details element

## Intent
The details element looks like a neat way to implement collapsible content without custom js. So, is it practical to use in a form?
- How well does keyboard access work?
- Any conflicts or issues with form content?
- How well will it work with a screen reader?
- What kind of content can we place in the `<details>` content?
  - form controls?
  - tooltips or popovers?
  - navigation?
  - other interactive content?
